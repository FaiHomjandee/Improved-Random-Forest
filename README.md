# Mixed MCDT and DT to Random Forest
My master thesis at Chulalongkorn University 2019   
I did the mixed of Minority Condensation Decisition Tree, and Standard Decisiton Tree for classification of imbalanced problems   
    
The purpose of our project is to try to improve a popular classifier named Random Forest (RF).    
We fixed the problem of Decision Trees (DT) in RF. Its classify return low of accuracy when they face with a complex of information as an imbalanced of the dataset. The results show better performance than other classifiers we compared.
