# Mixed MCDT and DT to Random Forest
My master thesis at Chulalongkorn University 2019   
I did the mixed of Minority Condensation Decisition Tree, and Standard Decisiton Tree for classification of imbalanced problems   
    
Purpose of our project is tried to improve a popular classifier named as Random Forest (RF).  
We fixed the problem of Decision Treev(DT) which they are collected within RF. Its classify return low of accuracy when they face with complex of imformation as a imbalanced of the dataset.
